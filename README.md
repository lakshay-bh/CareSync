# CareSync
The project comprises several microservices, each encapsulating specific business functionalities:​

Patient Service: Manages patient-related data and operations.​

Billing Service: Handles billing and payment processes.​

Auth Service: Manages authentication and user authorization.​

Analytics Service: Provides analytical insights based on collected data.​

API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate services.​

These services communicate with each other using RESTful APIs and gRPC, showcasing inter-service communication patterns in a microservices architecture.​

The project also includes an infrastructure directory, which likely contains configuration files and scripts for deploying the microservices, possibly using Docker and Kubernetes.
